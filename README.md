# Vue Router Setup Sample

When inside the project directory

### Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Learning Outcomes

Vue router injects the appropriate component into the file rather than requesting the server for a new file.

Vue intercepts the route through the URL and checks that so all the routing is done through the client. Therefore, the browswer will not always need to request for a new page from the server.

`<router-link> A link to something... </router-link>`

- Router Links are used rather than anchor tags.
- Router Links can be set to objects because routes are objects.

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
